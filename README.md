# Harvest

Harvest is an online marketplace that allows farmers to sell their goods to a wider audience than the local farmer's market. Our site features multi-tenancy, a recommendation engine, stripe payment support, and promotional codes. While this site has the security and features to support live use, it was intended as an experiment.
